## üöÄ Purpose

MUZIK helps you find the perfect music for whatever you're feeling. We often know our mood but have trouble finding songs that match it. With Muzik, you simply share how you're feeling, and the app uses emotion detection to create a playlist tailored to your mood. Whether you're looking for something chill, upbeat, or reflective, muzik curates the ideal soundtrack for the moment, enhancing your experience with every track.
This project gives you both a creative exploration and a technical demonstration, focusing on API integrations, sentiment analysis, and scalable system design.
