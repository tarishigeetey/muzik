## üöÄ Purpose
MUZIK helps you find the perfect music for whatever you're feeling. We often know our mood but have trouble finding songs that match it. With Muzik, you simply share how you're feeling, and the app uses emotion detection to create a playlist tailored to your mood. Whether you're looking for something chill, upbeat, or reflective, muzik curates the ideal soundtrack for the moment, enhancing your experience with every track.
This project gives you both a creative exploration and a technical demonstration, focusing on API integrations, sentiment analysis, and scalable system design.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS for a modern and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot to handle business logic and APIs.
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for secure and scalable data management.
- **APIs:**
   * Hugging Face: Emotion detection and sentiment analysis.
   * Spotify API: Song search and playlist generation.
- **Testing:** JUnit and Mockito for robust unit testing of backend services.

## üìö Lessons Learned

- API Integration Challenges: Managing OAuth flows and ensuring secure Spotify API access provided valuable insights into third-party API integration.
- Data Mapping: Designing efficient relationships between emotions, moods, and genres highlighted the importance of flexible and scalable database schemas.
- User-Centric Design: Creating an intuitive and engaging interface made me realize the value of combining functionality with user experience.
- Testing and Debugging: Writing comprehensive tests for API-driven functionality enhanced code reliability and reduced debugging time significantly.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works
1. Log in using your Spotify account via OAuth.
2. Describe your mood in a text box (e.g., "I'm feeling calm").
3. The app uses AI to analyze your input and determine your emotional state.
4. Based on the detected mood, playlists and songs are fetched from Spotify and displayed.
