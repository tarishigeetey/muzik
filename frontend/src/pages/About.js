                <p>When you're in the mood for music, you already know what you're feeling and what you needâ€”whether it's a genre, artist, or vibe to match your mood. <br /><strong>Muzik</strong> connects those emotional dots, offering personalized song recommendations that perfectly align with your mood.</p> 
                <p>Built as a creative experiment and technical showcase, Muzik explores API integrations, scalable design, and unit testing. Itâ€™s where code meets creativity.</p> 
                <p>In Jan 2025, I set myself the challenge of creating an MVP in just 2-3 weeksâ€”a timeframe that mimics a sprint. It was a journey of learning, from gathering requirements to building a web app without a step-by-step guide. Through research, peer advice, search through numerous websites for ideas and after lots of trial and error, Iâ€™m thrilled with the outcome!</p> 
                <p>I hope Muzik brings a fresh track to your playlist today! ðŸŽ¶</p>
